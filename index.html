  		<h1>    How does choosing what you learn enhance your memory? </h1>

   	<h2> Let's play a game! </h2>
   		<p> - Print out ten pictures of different objects of your choice, two copies for each </p>
   		<p> - Select twenty random Japanese characters from <a href="http://www.freejapaneselessons.com/lesson01.cfm"> here </a> and print them out </p>
   		<p> - On the two pictures of the same object, put two pictures of different Japanese characters on them </p>
   		<p> - Do this for the next nine objects </p>
   		<p> - Now get a friend to be experimented on! </p>
   		<p> - This is how the setup should look like: </p>
   		<img src="setup.png" style="margin: 0px 30px">
   		<p> - Ask your friend to choose a Japanese word, then lift up the picture and look at the object beneath it </p>
   		<p> - After this is done, show your friend a list of pictures which contain pictures s/he has seen and has not seen, and ask if s/he can recognize the picture </p>
   		<p> - Record how many pictures are remembered and how many forgotten </p>
   		<p> - This is the <span class="redboldtext"> choice condition </span> </p>
   		<p> - Repeat everything from the beginning with completely different objects, but this time <b> YOU </b> will be the one to choose which Japanese character to remove </p>
   		<p> - This is the <span class="redboldtext"> fixed condition </span> </p>
   		<p> - Compare the difference between the ratio of remembered/forgotten pictures between trial 1 and trial 2 </p>

   	
	<h3> Your friend probably remembered more objects during the choice condition rather than the fixed condition. Why is this the case? </h3>
		<img src="infographic.png" width = "100%">
		<p> - Let's look at the three phases: before encoding, during encoding, after encoding </p>
		<table border="1" style="width:100%">
			<tr>
			    <td> Before encoding </td>
			    <td> During encoding </td>
			    <td> After encoding </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td> The anticipation of choice can make the brain exhibit differential activity during choice and fixed trials, in particular the left striatum </td>
			    <td> Brain regions critical in the encoding of information (eg. hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, etc.) might display differential activity during choice and fixed trials </td> 
			    <td> During recognition task, the hippocampus, which plays a role in episodic memory, might show differential activity between choice and fixed trials </td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p> => We need to observe the differential activity that brain regions display between choice and fixed trials in each of the three phrases to understand the neural mechanism beneath enhanced memory </p>
		<p> => Need fMRI studies </p>

	<div class ="fMRI">
		<h4> fMRI Study </h4>
		<div class = "pad">
			<p> - 22 subjects </p>
		</div>
		<p> - <u> Phase 1</u>: behavioral test like the above game but with more pictures and the recognition test was 24 hours after the subjects saw the pictures </p>
		<p> - <u> Phase 2</u>: fMRI study </p>
		<div class = "fMRIsub">
			<p> If there is difference in brain activities between choice and fixed conditions, there will be differential BOLD activity between those conditions in one or more of the three phases (before, during, and after encoding) </p>	
		</div>
		<p> - <u> Phase 3</u>: recognition test </p>
		<div class = "fMRIsub"> 
			<p> Supposed there is differential BOLD activity in one or more of the three phases in some specified brain regions. If the difference in BOLD activity accounts for enhanced memory, there will be a correlation between the specified regions' activity and memory for objects presented </p> 
		</div>
	</div>


	<h5> fMRI Results </h5>
	<p> - <u> Before encoding</u>: </p> 
		<div class = "fMRIsub">
			<p> There is greater BOLD activity in the left striatum in the choice than the fixed conditions </p>
			<p> Left striatal activation is significantly related to memory for objects </p>
			<p> <span class ="redboldtext"> => Left striatal activation in choice conditions is correlated with better memory </span> </p>
		</div>
	<img src="beforefMRI.png" width="50%">
	<p> - <u> During encoding</u>: There is no difference in brain activities between choice and fixed conditions </p> 
	<p> - <u> After encoding</u>: </p> 
		<div class = "fMRIsub">
			<p> In successfully remembered objects in CHOICE conditions, left striatal activation before encoding is correlated with right hippocampal activation </p>
			<p> <span class ="redboldtext"> => Coupling between left striatal activation and right hippocampal activation predicts better memory </span> </p>
		</div>
	<img src="afterfMRI.png" width="50%">

	<h6> Conclusions </h6>
		<img src="infographicResults.png" width = "100%">
		<p> - When subjects have a choice, their anticipatory striatal activity before encoding is correlated with better memory </p>
		<p> - Successful memory for objects in the choice condition is correlated with interactions between striatum and hippocampus </p>
		<p> <span class = "redboldtext"> => The neural mechanism behind why people have better memory in the choice condition is due to interactions between striatal activity before encoding and hippocampal activity during encoding </span> </p>

	<div class="questions">
		<h7> But what if the subjects have better memory simply because they look at the objects they "choose" longer? </h7>
		<p> The researchers have done an eye-tracking study to track how much time the subjects spend on viewing the objects during the choice versus the fixed condition. They actually found that the subjects spent slightly longer time viewing the objects in the FIXED rather than the choice condition! </p>

		<h8> Other questions we can ask </h8>
		<p> Would the subjects without striatum still have better memory for objects during the choice condition? This can test whether striatum-hippocampus is the only interaction important for enhanced memory </p>
		<p> Since the fMRI study only focuses on a specific region of interest (ROI) in the hippocampus, the researchers might have missed other important interactions contributing the the enhanced memory. What would those be? </p>
