  		<h1>    How does choosing what you learn enhance your memory? </h1>

   	<h2> Let's play a game! </h2>
   		<p> - Print out ten pictures of different objects of your choice, two copies for each </p>
   		<p> - Select twenty random Japanese characters from <a href="http://www.freejapaneselessons.com/lesson01.cfm"> here </a> and print them out </p>
   		<p> - On the two pictures of the same object, put two pictures of different Japanese characters on them </p>
   		<p> - Do this for the next nine objects </p>
   		<p> - Now get a friend to be experimented on! </p>
   		<p> - This is how the setup should look like: </p>
   		<img src="setup.png" style="margin: 0px 30px">
   		<p> - Ask your friend to choose a Japanese word, then lift up the picture and look at the object beneath it </p>
   		<p> - After this is done, show your friend a list of pictures which contain pictures s/he has seen and has not seen, and ask if s/he can recognize the picture </p>
   		<p> - Record how many pictures are remembered and how many forgotten </p>
   		<p> - This is the <span class="redboldtext"> choice condition </span> </p>
   		<p> - Repeat everything from the beginning with completely different objects, but this time <b> YOU </b> will be the one to choose which Japanese character to remove </p>
   		<p> - This is the <span class="redboldtext"> fixed condition </span> </p>
   		<p> - Compare the difference between the ratio of remembered/forgotten pictures between trial 1 and trial 2 </p>

   	
	<h3> Your friend probably remembered more objects during the choice condition rather than the fixed condition. Why is this the case? </h3>
		<img src="infographic.png" width = "100%" style="margin: 0px 30px">
		<p> - Let's look at the three phases: before encoding, during encoding, after encoding </p>
		<table border="1" style="width:100%">
			<tr>
			    <td> Before encoding </td>
			    <td> During encoding </td>
			    <td> After encoding </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td> The anticipation of choice can make the brain exhibit differential activity during choice and fixed trials, in particular the left striatum </td>
			    <td> Brain regions critical in the encoding of information (eg. hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, etc.) might display differential activity during choice and fixed trials </td> 
			    <td> During recognition task, the hippocampus, which plays a role in episodic memory, might show differential activity between choice and fixed trials </td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p> => We need to observe the differential activity that brain regions display between choice and fixed trials in each of the three phrases to understand the neural mechanism beneath enhanced memory </p>
